## Project Overview

This project is a collection of Python scripts for visualizing key concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The visualizations include bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, and stability analysis of fixed points. These tools are essential for understanding the complex behaviors that arise in nonlinear systems.

## Visualizations

### Bifurcation Diagram of Logistic Map

The logistic map is a classic example of how complex, chaotic behavior can arise from simple nonlinear dynamical equations. The bifurcation diagram shows how the fixed points of the logistic map change as the parameter varies.

### Lyapunov Exponent of Logistic Map

The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the rate at which nearby trajectories diverge. For the logistic map, this exponent can indicate whether the system is in a stable, periodic, or chaotic regime.

### Bifurcation Diagram of \( x + B \tanh(x) \) Function

This visualization shows the bifurcation behavior of the function \( x + B \tanh(x) \). By varying the parameter \( B \), we can observe how the fixed points and their stability change.

### Fixed Points and Their Stabilities of \( \sin(x) \) Function

This script calculates and visualizes the fixed points of the \( \sin(x) \) function and analyzes their stability. This is useful for understanding the behavior of sinusoidal nonlinear systems.

## Installation

To run these visualizations locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nonlinear-dynamics-chaos.git
   cd nonlinear-dynamics-chaos

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
## Usage
Each script can be run independently. For example, to generate the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map, execute:

```bash
python bifurcation_logistic_map.py
 ```
Output images will be saved in the images/ directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or new visualizations to add, please fork the repository and create a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
