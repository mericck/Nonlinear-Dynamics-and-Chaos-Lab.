# Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos
Welcome to the Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos Visualizations project! This repository contains code developed during my internship in Inha University (South Korea), focusing on the visualization of various concepts in nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and stability.

#  Project Overview
This project is a collection of Python scripts for visualizing key concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The visualizations include bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, and stability analysis of fixed points. These tools are essential for understanding the complex behaviors that arise in nonlinear systems.
#  Visualizations
#  Bifurcation Diagram of Logistic Map
The logistic map is a classic example of how complex, chaotic behavior can arise from simple nonlinear dynamical equations. The bifurcation diagram shows how the fixed points of the logistic map change as the parameter varies.
#  Lyapunov Exponent of Logistic Map
The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the rate at which nearby trajectories diverge. For the logistic map, this exponent can indicate whether the system is in a stable, periodic, or chaotic regime.
#  Fixed Points and Their Stabilities of sin(x) function
This script calculates and visualizes the fixed points of the sin(x) function and analyzes their stability. This is useful for understanding the behavior of sinusoidal nonlinear systems.
